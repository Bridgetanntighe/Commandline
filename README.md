><h1>Filter a SQL query </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
As a security analyst, knowing how to make better queries to retrieve specific pieces of data can help find the security-related information needed more efficiently.

In this lab activity, I will show how to apply basic filters to SQL queries to retrieve information from a MariaDB database.


<h2>List all organization machines</h2>

<h2>Identify employee machines</h2>
My team recently discovered that there are issues with machines in the South building. In this task, I need to obtain certain employee and computer information.

A machine in <i>'South-109'</i> has an issue. I need to determine which employee uses that computer to send them an alert.
